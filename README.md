# CFD-Program

DISCLAIMER:
This Program is made on Blender Version 3.1.2 
Hence it is suggested for users to use Version 3.1 or higher 

Needless to say the more number of verticies that the test model has the slower the render time

Please keep in mind that you must know the limitations of your GPU when running the program as
setting the particle count more than what your GPU can handle can cause the following:
- Severe lag
- Constant crashes
- Failure of the physics engine
- Particles behaving abnormally
- Particles speed not coordinating with colour

Minimum Requirements:
-Blender Version 3.0
-GTX 1050
-Intel i5 8th-gen/Ryzen 5 3600
-8GB RAM

You can refer my tutorial video through this link : https://youtu.be/777i4VFTtw4

or read the instructions below

HOW TO SETUP A MODEL:
Step 1:Import a model of your choice
Step 2:Turn on collision in the Physics properties section
Step 3:Set the Stickiness to 2.000
Step 4:Set Friction to desired amount (Reference given below)

Friction Value  |  Item
0.1             |  Glass/Polished Metal
0.3             |  Glossy Paint
0.45            |  Matte Paint/Drywall
0.6             |  wood/leather
0.8             |  Rock/Stone/cloth

After you have setup the model.
Hit the spacebar and see the simulation in real time.

Keep in mind if you wish to move around pause the Simulation and then do so else the program can crash.

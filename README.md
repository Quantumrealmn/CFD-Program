# CFD-Program

This Program is made on Blender Version 3.1.2 
Hence it is suggested for users to use Version 3.1 or higher 

You can refer my tutorial video through this link : https://youtu.be/777i4VFTtw4

or read the instructions below

How to setup a model:
Step 1:Import a model of your choice
Step 2:Turn on collision in the Physics properties section
Step 3:Set the Stickiness to 2.000
Step 4:Set Friction to desired amount (Reference given below)

Friction Amount |  Item
0.1             |  Glass/Polished Metal
0.3             |  Glossy Paint
0.45            |  Matte Paint/Drywall
0.6             |  wood/leather
0.8             |  Rock/Stone/cloth

After you have setup the model.
Hit the spacebar and see the simulation in real time.

Keep in mind if you wish to move around pause the Simulation and then do so else the program will crash.
